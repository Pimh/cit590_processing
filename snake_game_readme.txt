README - Snake game
Pimkhuan(Pim) Hananta-anan

1. The minimum features needed for a playable game are as follows:

- Create a snake that can be maneuvered by a player through arrow keys 
- If no arrow keys have been pressed, the snake should keep moving in the same direction
- Create an apple at a random location, and when it is eaten by the snake, create a new apple at a new location. Note that the location of the apple should not overlap with the location of the snake body
- Update the score when an apple gets eaten
- The game is over when the head of the snake hits the wall or its own body

2. The followings are the features and improvements I added to the game:
- Lengthen the snake with time
- Add obstacles as the score goes up. The snake will die if it hits these obstacles.
  The location of the obstacles cannot overlap with the apple and the snake body


3. A brief description of how to play the game:

This is a Snake game where a player maneuvers the snake in order to eat an apple that appears in a random location in the window. The player receives a score for each apple eaten by the snake. The goal of the game is to reach the highest score possible. There is no score cap but the game will get more and more difficult as the snake grows and more obstacles are created. Below are the general rules of the game:
- Use the arrow keys - left, right, up, and down to maneuver the snake
- The game is over if the snake hits the outer wall, the rectangular obstacles, or its own body (This also means that it will die if it goes in reverse direction).
